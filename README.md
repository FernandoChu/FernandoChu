### Hi there 👋

I'm Fernando Chu, and I'm very interested in topics related to mathematical logic. In particular, I'm learning more about type theories, and using them to formalize mathematics.

**About me**

- 🎓 Master in Pure Mathematics at Universidad Nacional Mayor de San Marcos.
- 💻 My favorite language is Agda, and I've done some formalizations in personal and public projects.
- ❤️ I'm a firm believer of open software and science.
- 💬 Feel free to contact me about anything :)
