### Hi there 👋

I'm Fernando Chu, a first year PhD Student at Utrecht University, working under [Paige North](https://paigenorth.github.io/).
My main interests revolve around category theory and type theory. In particular, I'd like to better understand how these can be used to tackle classical problems, generate better abstractions and/or facilitate formalization of results into proof assistants.

**About me**

- 🎓 Master in Pure Mathematics at Universidad Nacional Mayor de San Marcos.
- 💻 My favorite language is Agda, and I've done some formalizations in personal and public projects.
- ❤️ I'm a firm believer of open software and science.
- 💬 Feel free to contact me about anything :)
